Problem Statement:
------------------
As per details shared by the development team, the new application release has some dependencies on the back end.
There are some packages/services that need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter.
As per requirements please perform the following steps:

a. Install nscd package on all the application servers.
b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.
------------------
Solution:
Login to respective application server to install postfix on it.

stapp01 -
Command to login into stapp01 application server
    thor@jump_host ~$ sudo ssh tony@stapp01
Command to install postfix on server
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo yum install -y nscd
Command to check package install on system or not 
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ yum list nscd
Command to check service status
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ systemctl status nscd
Command to start the service
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo systemctl start nscd

Check the status again after starting the service.
Repeat the same steps for rest of the application servers.
